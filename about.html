                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    &Tab;<span class="italics">Hello!</span> My name is Noah Sell, I'm a web designer and developer currently based in Fargo, North Dakota with plans of moving closer to the Twin Cities area this October. I have a passion for continuously learning, solving problems, and bringing my ideas to life. Each project that I take on is a puzzle to be solved, it may have many different correct solutions, but the fun part is working out which solution is the best one and putting it together.
                </p>
                <span class="lineBreak"></span>
                <p>
                    &Tab;I took a somewhat unconventional path through my higher education that I believe has made me a much more well-rounded individual and given me a plethora of real-world experience that I wouldn't have gained otherwise. In 2018 I was pursuing degrees in Communication and Psychology, and while I enjoyed what I was learning, I realized that I had a creative itch that wouldn't be satisfied if I continued down that path. In 2020 I made the difficult decision to withdraw from my program and started working at Starbucks, which offers free tuition through Arizona State University, and in the summer of 2021 I began taking online classes to earn a degree in Full-Stack Web Development.
                </p>
                <span class="lineBreak"></span>
                <p>
                    &Tab;Over the last four years I have developed much stronger leadership skills, self-discipline, and overall confidence, which have earned me promotions at work, but more importantly they're traits I will be able to take with me as I take the next steps in my career, and I'm looking forward to what comes next!
