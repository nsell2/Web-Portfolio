                            Nobody's Favorite is a punk rock band based out of Moorhead, MN that was formed in 2023. As the band is still fairly new, they needed a website that would help boost their name recognition, display dates of upcoming performances, and give a preview of the merchandise that they sell at their shows.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <span class="lineBreak"></span>

                        <span id="process">
                            I first had the client send me the band's logo, photos of merchandise options, candids from their past performances, and the information on their next upcoming shows. This helped me better understand the band's identity, which was important for selecting a color scheme and typography for the website. I then created a simple outline that I followed as I wrote the HTML code for the website's content. Once that was finished, I wrote the CSS and JavaScript code that gave the website its style and functionality.

                        <span id="results">
                            The website was completed before the deadline and works as intended. The band was very pleased when they were sent the final result. It has a clean and simple layout that can easily be edited or added to if the band needs something changed, but still feels like a natural extension of the band's identity.

                            The Digital Publishing course at ASU teaches students to use industry-standard methods and technologies to produce web and print publication materials. The final project for this course was to research various design conferences before selecting one and creating various marketing materials for it.

                            The first step in this project was researching the design conference I chose, Creative South, to get a sense of the organization's brand identity. Next, I selected the color palettes and fonts to use in my marketing materials, keeping everything cohesive. Once I had a good understanding of what information I would need to include in each of my materials, I started sketching them all out on paper. After I had all of my ideas written down and sketched out, I used Adobe InDesign to create the four different types of marketing materials.

                            I was able to complete all of the deliverables by their due date, which included a web advertisement banner, a name tag/badge to be worn on a lanyard, a folding table tent, and a booklet with details about the conference. I was very happy with how each of the designs turned out and I got an A on the project as a whole.

                            The Graphic Information Technology Senior Project is an encapsulation of everything students learn throughout their program at ASU. I decided to create an online beginner's guide for the game 'Dungeons and Dragons' with introductory information about the game's rules and a page for users to create their own character.

                            The first step in my process was to research and compile inspiration for the website's layout and visual elements. I decided to organize the main content into four chapters and set it against a background that looked like pages of a large book. I then used Adobe Illustrator to create the background image and the Table of Contents icon. From there, the bulk of the project involved writing and organizing the contents of each "chapter," paying close attention to ensuring it would be easily understood by users who are unfamiliar with the game. Once that was all finished, my next step was to create the "Character Creator" page. I incorporated a simple form that users could fill out and submit, then used JavaScript to save their answers and display their character's information neatly on the page.

                            This project was the largest I have completed in such a short amount of time, and it taught me a lot about the way I work while under the pressure of a looming deadline. Wile I completed this project before the deadline and was happy with the final result, there were still some less vital elements and functions that I would have liked to incorporate but had to cut due to time constraints.
